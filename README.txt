	The objective of this project was to create a web based financial aid application that can display a candlestick graph of a chosen company’s stock. The interface that we created is self-explanatory and easy to use up to the point where you see the graph that you created. There are tools on the right side of the graph that don’t really have too much explanation. The top tool that looks like a rainbow colored circle is a link that brings the user to the bokeh website. This could be useful if a user is curious about how we created the graph. The second tool that looks like four arrows is a pan tool that allows the user to shift what part of the graph that they’re looking at. The third tool that looks like a magnifying glass is a box zoom tool. This allows a user to draw a box around the part of the graph that they want to zoom to. The fourth tool is a wheel zoom that allows the user to zoom into the graph using their mouse scroller. The fifth tool is a save button that allows the user to save an image of the graph to their computer if they wanted to look at or use it in the future. The sixth tool is a reset button that can be used to display the full graph again after zooming in. The last tool is a help button that brings you to the bokeh web page that explains the tools. One other thing to note about our project is that when you create a graph it is done in another tab. If the user wants to keep creating more graphs they have to switch back to our app’s tab. Our app will then be displaying the company select page so that the user can immediately begin creating another graph. 
	The python libraries that we are using in our project are flask to build the web app, wt forms to ask for and receive user input, pandas datareader for the web skimming part where we get stock data from yahoo, datetime which is used when asking the user to specify the start and end date of their graph and ensuring that a valid date is inputted, and bokeh to create the candlestick graph of the stock. Other resources that we used for this project are pictures of the company logos that our app supports. All these logos were simply grabbed from google images. 
	Some extra features that we ended up implementing in our project that were not in the project proposal include the ability to specify the start and end date of when you want to see the stock data for the chosen company. As we created the project implementing this seemed that a natural and seemless thing to do. We also thought that adding a news section to the project would be a good idea since news and stocks kind of go together. This news section was something that we did not get to show off during our presentation as it wasn’t quite finished, but it definitely adds a unique element to our project. Other than that, our project fits exactly what we outlined in our project proposal and expected to accomplish. 
	A basic idea of the separation of work throughout this project can be seen in our team members page on our web app. To outline it hear as well, James Hudson oversaw the utilization of flask to create the web app. Diego Castro was in charge of using the pandas data reader and the datetime objects to grab the stock data from yahoo. Andres Paz Vicca deployed the candlestick graph of the user chosen company between the specified days using bokeh. Gianmarco Beteta used bootstrap to modify the look of our website. By separating the work like this each person had a clear role and we were able to come together and create a web application that we can all be proud of.
